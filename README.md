# 💯 100 Days of DSA — Python & C++

> A 100-day journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** in both **Python** 🐍 and **C++** 💻 — building logic, OOP skills, and consistency day by day.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this repository is to:
- Strengthen **problem-solving skills** using both **Python** and **C++**
- Understand **OOP concepts deeply** in both languages
- Build a **solid foundation** in core Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Stacks, Queues, Graphs, etc.)
- Maintain a daily **learning & reflection log** to stay consistent

---

## 🧩 Languages Used

| Language | Focus |
|-----------|--------|
| 🐍 Python | Logic building, readability, and concept clarity |
| 💻 C++ | Performance, syntax depth, and pointer-level understanding |

---

## 📆 Progress Tracker

| Day | Topic | Python | C++ | Notes |Status|
|-----|--------|--------|------|-------|-----|
| 1 | Python OOP Basics | ✅ | — | Classes, `__init__`, `self` |Completed ✅|
| 2 | C++ OOP Basics | ✅ | ✅ | Constructors, `this` keyword |Coming soon|
| 3 | Inheritance | ✅ | ✅ | Method overriding |Coming soon|
| 4 | Binary Tree Intro | ✅ | ✅ | Recursion & traversal |Coming soon|
| 5 | Linked List Basics | ⏳ | — | Node creation |Coming soon|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

🕓 *Updating daily — stay tuned!*

## 🧠 Learning Approach

### 1️⃣ Understand the Concept
Before writing code, visualize the problem and understand the underlying data structure.

### 2️⃣ Solve in Python First
Python helps focus on **logic clarity** and recursion understanding.

### 3️⃣ Recreate in C++
C++ builds your **performance mindset** and pointer-level understanding.

### 4️⃣ Reflect Daily
Each day’s folder includes:
- Problem statement (`problem.md`)
- Python solution
- C++ solution
- Notes or explanation file

## 💬 Daily Reflection Example

> ✨ **Day 6 — Binary Tree Inorder Traversal**
>
> - Learned recursion logic using `left → root → right`
> - Understood `self` in Python and `this` in C++
> - Implemented both recursive and iterative versions
> - Next: Try preorder and postorder traversals

## 🚀 Tools & Environment

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| VS Code | Coding |
| GitHub | Tracking & logging |
| LeetCode / GfG | Problem practice |
| ChatGPT (GPT-5) | Concept explanation & debugging help |
